# Shape Trainer

by Sawyer Wall

Shape Trainer is a small browser game where you try to memorize and recreate randomly generated shapes.

## Running the Game

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build step or server is required—just open the file directly.
2. The menu provides buttons for **Memorization**, **Dexterity**, and **About**. The Memorization menu includes the **Shape Trainer** and a list of scenario challenges.

## Basic Controls

- **Time (sec)** – How long the shape stays visible before you draw.
- **Sides** – The number of sides of the polygon (or pick *Point* or *Line Segment*).
- **Size** – Small, Medium, or Big shapes.
- **Grid** – Show an optional grid on the canvas.
- **Point-to-Point / Freehand** – Toggle how you draw. Point-to-point lets you place dots; freehand lets you draw with the pointer.
  In freehand mode, once you release your line a tone plays indicating how close your drawing was to the hidden shape.
- **Highest/Lowest/Left-most/Right-most** – When checked, these reference points of the shape will remain visible while you draw.
- **New Shape** – Generate a new random shape.
- **Previous Shape** – View the last shape again.
- **Retry Shape** – Try drawing the current shape again.

When you are done drawing, the original shape is revealed so you can compare.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies aside from a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.
